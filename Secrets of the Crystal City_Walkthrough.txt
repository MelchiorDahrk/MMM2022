		Telvanni/Non-Faction: Latest Rumors from Telvanni members in Sadrith Mora.

		Talk to Neloth to start the quest.

		Go to `coc "Massama Cave"` (or follow directions since this will teleport you to the wrong entrance).
		Find the entrance to Massama and talk to the inhabitants who will direct you to Ravos Savani.

	Quest 6: The Uxith-Kei
		You have two options here: kill the Uxith-Kei and take Trinibane Manor by force. Or accept Vasteix's offer and join the 		Uxith-Kei and they will give you the manor. You'll gain access to their services afterwards.
